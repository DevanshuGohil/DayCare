## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have the Java Development Kit installed on your computer. You can download it from [Oracle's JDK 16 website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk16-archive-downloads.html).
- **IDE (Optional)**: An Integrated Development Environment like Netbeans (Ideally Version 20).

## Steps to Run the Application

1. **Download the Application**:
   - If it's source code, ensure all files are downloaded, maintaining the directory structure.

2. **Using Command Line**:
   - Open your command line tool (Command Prompt, Terminal, etc.).
   - If it's source code, compile the Java files first using:
     ```
     javac [MainClassName].java
     ```
     Then run the application using:
     ```
     java [MainClassName]
     ```

3. **Using an IDE**:
   - Open your IDE and import the application as a project (steps may vary based on the IDE).
   - Build/compile the project using the IDE's build tool.
   - Run the application through the IDEâ€™s run tool.

## Documents

Please check the OOD Project Docs and Video for the presentation, instructions and working video of the Application

## Troubleshooting

- **Java Version Mismatch**: Ensure the JDK version matches the application's requirement.
- **Missing Dependencies**: If the application depends on external libraries, ensure they are properly included in the classpath.
- **Main Class Not Found**: Verify that the correct main class name is specified while running the application.
